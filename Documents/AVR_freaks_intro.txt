AVR freaks intro:

This posting is a development of PCB_111000_UNO.  Functions originally supplied by the UNO are obtained as follows:

USB connectivity:	A CP2102 module with USB connector soldered directly to the PCB
Bootloader IC:	An Atmega328 loaded with a hex/text bootloader is also soldered to the PCB

Another development is use of an ATtiny1606 to drive the display. The I2C bus used to connect the two ICs is replaced by a one wire firmware UART link.

A UNO loaded with a modified version of the project “UNO_as_an_AVR_programmer” is used to calibrate the Atmega328 and upload the bootloader.
Similarly a modified version of “UNO_as_an_UPDI_programmer” is used to program the ATtiny1606.

The only really new code is project “cal_one_wire_comms” used to align the one wire UART clocks.


The posting contains:
	The pdf file "Introducing_PCB111000_CP2102"
	Eagle pcb schematic and board files and parts list
	System code and hex files.
	A selection of user projects 
	A project commentary

All user projects can easily be modified to work with PCB_111000_UNO or indeed the original PCB_111000 by replacing the one wire link with an I2C link.
