All resets cause program control to jump to the bootloader
Note: logic is inverted. This means that
	Clearing a register reaves it containing 0xFF
	Clearing a bit leaves it as a 1
	Setting a bit leaves it as a 0


reset_ctl_reg (0x3FC)
bit 0	POR_bit				At POR set reg to ~1		
bit 1	WDTout_bit			Read-modify-write
bit 2	Run_BL_bit			Read-modify-write
bit 3	prtD				At "r" set reg to ~8
bit 4	Flagged WDTout			Set reg to ~0x10
bit 5	WDTout with ISR 		Set reg to ~0x20
bit 6	SW_reset			Set reg to ~0x40


Apply Power 	
Prog control jumps to 0x7000
	POR_bit is set		0x3FC = ~1	(0b1111 1110)

Prog control jumps to User app which
	reads reset_ctl_reg
	and clears it	 	0x3FC = ~0	(0b1111 1111)
	and when Reset CTL 
	switch is pulsed	
	Sets Run_BL_bit		0x3FC &= ~4	(0b1111 1011)
	Does a SW_reset 

Prog control jumps to 0x7000
	WDTout_bit is set	0x3FC &= ~2	(0b1111 1001)
Test Run_BL_bit
  If it is set the prtD.. prompt is generated
Press p to program	SW_reset generated when done
prtD.. prompt repeated
	Press r 
	prtD bit is set 
	Run_BL_bit is cleared	0x3FC = ~8	(0b1111 0111)
	SW_reset executed
	WDTout_bit is set	0x3FC &= ~2	(0b1111 0101)
prtD_bit is tested as set and therefore 
Prog control jumps to User app which 
	reads reset_ctl_reg
	and clears it	 	0x3FC = ~0	(0b1111 1111)
	and then runs

When Reset CTL switch is pulsed
	Run_BL_bit is set
	SW_reset is executed
Prog control jumps to 0x7000
prtD... prompt is generated because
	Run_BL_bit and WDTout_bit_bit are both set

If user app includes a SW_reset
	Prog control jumps to 0x7000
	WDTout_bit is set	0x3FC &= ~2	(0b1111 1101)
	Run_BL_bit is tested
	It is clear and therefore control passes back to the user app.
