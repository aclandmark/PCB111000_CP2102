All resets cause program control tojump to the bootloader
Note: logic is inverted. This means that
	Clearing a register reaves it containing 0xFF
	Clearing a bit leaves it as a 1
	Setting a bit leaves it as a 0

Apply power with Reset control switch left in the up (default) position

Program control jumps to the bootloader which: 
	Reads MCUSR (indicates POR). 
	Sets MCUSR to zero
	Executes "clear_reset_control_reg" (EEPROM 0x3FC)
	Passes control to a user application

User presses Reset control switch for 350mS and the user app:
	Executes "setRunBL_bit" (EEPROM 0x3FC bit 1)
	Triggers a WTDout

Program control jumps to the bootloader which:
	Reads MCUSR (indicates WDTout).
	Executes "setWD_RF_bit" (EEPROM 0x3FC bit 0)
	Prints the "p/r/t/D......." prompt

User presses "p" for programming:
	This terminates with a WDTout
	Restores the "p/r/t/D......." prompt

User presses "r" to run the program. Bootloader executes:
	"clear_RunBL_bit" (EEPROM 0x3FC bit 1)
	eeprom_write_byte((uint8_t*)0x3F5, 0xFF);	(clears user_prog_reset_ctl_reg)


The user program:

	Reads 0x3FC: If it equals 0xFF the reset is a POR
	Reads 0x3F5: If it equals 0xFF the program is triggered by the "p/r/t/D......." prompt	
	Clears bit 0 of the reset control register (0x3FC) after a WDTout
	Clears bit 2 of the reset control register (0x3FC) after a POR.

	Sets bit 0 of 0x3F5 when it runs for the first time
	Sets bit 2 of 0x3FC when it runs following a POR
	Sets bit 1 0f 0x3F5 for a flagged WDTout after which it clears it.
	Sets bit 2 0f 0x3F5 for a WDTout with ISR after which it clears it.
